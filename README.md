🐍 Comprehensive Python Learning Portfolio
This repository is a collection of my practice scripts, assignments, and small personal projects developed in Python. It primarily contains Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) and standalone Python files (.py) covering a broad range of fundamental, intermediate, and advanced programming concepts.

🌟 Key Concepts and Project Highlights
This portfolio demonstrates skills and knowledge across various aspects of Python programming:

Advanced Python & OOP: Deep dives into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) pillars like Polymorphism, the use of Static Methods, new syntax like match-case statements, and functions like super() and Scope Resolution.

Foundational Structures: Robust coverage of core data types and control flow, including Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, Tuples, Loops (for and while), and Type Conversion.

Mini-Projects & Games: Fun, interactive applications such as a Slot Machine, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Quiz Game, Number Guessing Game, and a Shopping Cart Program.

Practical Utilities: Real-world tools demonstrating file I/O and specific logic, including PDF-to-Audio conversion, Temperature Converter, and Weight Converter.

Error Handling & I/O: Practice in Exception Handling and general File Management.

🚀 Getting Started
To run any of the scripts or notebooks in this repository, you'll need Python 3 installed on your local machine.

Prerequisites
To use the Jupyter Notebooks, you will need the jupyter package. If you plan to run the utility scripts like pdftoaudio.py, you may also need external libraries like pyttsx3 and PyPDF2.

Bash

# It's recommended to create and activate a virtual environment first
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows

# Install the necessary packages (including dependencies for notebooks and utility scripts)
pip install jupyter notebook pyttsx3 PyPDF2
Cloning the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/python.git
cd python
🏃 How to Run the Files
For Python Scripts (.py files)
To run a standalone script, navigate to the repository directory and execute the file using the Python interpreter:

Bash

python temperature-converter.py
For Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files)
To open and interact with the notebooks, start the Jupyter Notebook server:


jupyter notebook
This will open a browser window. You can then click on any .ipynb file to open and run the cells interactively.

🤝 Contribution
As this is primarily a personal learning repository, contributions are not actively sought at this time. Feedback on the code or concepts is always welcome!
